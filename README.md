## How?
Users check in to a bar, and vote on what team is in the vast majority at their time there. Using a sorting algorithim the NFL team with the highest amounts of votes for each bar will be the "designated" team for that bar.

## Approach taken

<br>
Starting off the project, I made sure to setup my database from the get go. Then I looked up documentation on the certain APIs I was thinking of using. After numerous tries, I narrowed it down and was able to pull from the api and store it in my own. From there, I worked on the map being displayed, once I had that I was able to grab all the data from api that was just stored and use it to plot my bars on the map.

## Installation instructions
Click on the repo links for the front-end and back-end and clone them. Then npm install in the back-end. and run http-server on your front end through your terminal and you're good to go.

## Unsolved problems
Sadly, I didn't get to the sorting of votes, and or comments for each of my bars. I'm sure that I will be able to after this week, but from there When I do get that. Next step would be to display each icon on the map as the 'residing team' for each bar.
